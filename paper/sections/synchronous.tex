In this section we describe the ideal functionality and protocol for a simple byzantine broadcast in the synchronous model.
The function is modelled after the secure function evaluation functionality, $\F_{\msf{SFE}}^{f,Rnd}$, described in ~\cite{katz-clock}.
Secure function evaluation computes the output of a single function from the inputs of the parties.
The function being evaluated must be computable in one round in the ideal world, meaning parties don't have to give input more than once.
In our case, the ideal function for a byantine broadcast, $f$ (shown below), with a dealier, $\mathcal{D}$, just selects the dealer's input.

\[ f_{bc}(x_1,...,x_n) := x_{\mathcal{D}} \]

The functionality proceeds in rounds, $l$, until $Rnd$ rounds have elapsed.
At the end of $Rnd$ rounds it computes the function $f$ on the inputs of all parties that have provided input and sends output to each of them.
In every round, the functionality requires the environment to activate each party at least $|\mathcal{P}|$ times before increenting the round $l$. 
Everytime a party is activated by a party asking for \msf{output}, the functionality activates the the simulator.
With $n$ activations, the simulator can sufficiently simulate the real world protocol and use the activations provdided by the functionality, to activate and perform computation.
For example, for a party $p_i$, on activation $k$ within a round, the simulator simulates $p_i$'s interaction with party $p_k$ in the real world.
It will read messages from $p_k$ to $p_i$, perform any local computation, and potentially send messages to $p_k$ for subsequent rounds.

Similarly, such a structure design must also be present in the real world, where the environment will provide the same $n$ \msf{output} to each itm.

Additionally, the functionality is identical to the SFE functionality except for assumptions made for the application at hand.}
\end{figure}

The ideal functionality of for byzantine broadcast is described in Figure ~\ref{fig:functionality:broadcast}
The functionality is cast as a secure function evaluation where the function is as described above.
In our case we simplify the SFE functionality instead of just parmeterizing it with the function $f_{\msf{bc}}$ gives its simplicity.
The only simplification made to SFE is that the functionality only waits for the dealer's input (in SFE this equates to assuming all other parties' inputs are already set).
Furthermore, the function $f_{\msf{BC}}$ is put in place in the functionality.

	\label{fig:protocol:asyncbracha}
	\caption{The original asynchronous broadcast protocol proposed by Bracha~\cite{bracha-broadcast}. The protocol proceeds in three rounds and terminates if enough messages are delivered.}
\end{figure}

Next we introduce a real world protocol that realized the ideal functionality.
We use the asynchronous broadcast primitive introduced by Bracha~\cite{bracha-broadcast} that tolerates $\frac{n}{3}$ byzantine failures.
Below, we introduce the same broadcast protocol cast in the synchronous model.
We modify the protocol in the following ways:

\begin{itemize}
	\item First, the protocol has to be updates to reflect the interace offered by the ideal functionality. In the ideal world, the environment gives $|\mathcal{P}|$ activations to each party in each round. In the real world protocol, on the first activation of a party in a round $r$, the party $p_i$ fetches incoming messages from previous rounds, computes the messages to be sent in this round, $\{m_{i,j,r}\}_{j}$, and uses the next $|\mathcal{P}|$ rounds to send those messages to the other parties.
	\item Second, the protocol is modified to only accept certain messages in certain rounds. For example, the hones dealer will only accept $(input,v)$ from the environment in the first round, all parties will only accept $(VAL,v)$ messages in the second tound, and so on.
\end{itemize}

These changes take the form of a wrapper $\mathcal{W}_{\msf{synchronous}}$ shown in Figure \ref{fig:wrapper:synchronous}.

\begin{figure}
	\input{figures/wrapper}
	\label{fig:wrapper:synchronous}
	\caption{This wrapper implements the enhancements made to the protocol to conform to the interace of the ideal functionality \Fbc. It reads in incoming messages in the first activation of a round and uses the next $|\mathcal{P}|$ activations to send messages to others.}

{\bf Theorem.} {\em Protocol $\Pi_{\msf{Bracha}}$ securely realized \Fbc in the $\{\Fbdsec,\Fclock \}$-hybrid world. Assume a stateic adversary corrupted up to $\frac{n}{3}$ parties.}

Consider the simulator, $\mathcal{S}$, above.

If the dealer $\mathcal{D}$ is honest: In the ideal world, $\mathcal{D}$ gives input $v$ to $\F_{\msf{Bracha}}$ which gives leaks it to $\mathcal{S}$.
The simulator submits the input to it all of the locl $\Fsync{\mathcal{D}}{p_i}$ for $p_i \in  \mathcal{P}$.

$\mathcal{S}$ expects to receive $|\mathcal{P}|$ activations from $\F_{\msf{Bracha}}$ when ideal world parties attempt to read output from the functionality.
In each activation, the simulator sufficiently ensures each party reads messages from all other parties and simualated state changes and increment the local \Fclock.

The functionality waits $Rnd = 3$ rounds to deliver the output. In the first round $|\mathcal{P}|^2$ activations ensure all \msf{ECHO} messages are sent.
In functionality round 2, activations ensure that all \msf{READY} messages are sent. The final functionality round 3, all \msf{READY}s are delivered and the simulates real world parties all output a value $v$.
By the proof of the Bracha protocol, all real world parties output the same value. The simulator instructs 

\paragraph{Typo in Katz paper}
In synchronous protocols, parties can send at most $n = |\mathcal{P}|-1$ messages, one message to each other participant in the protocol.
According to the functionality $\Fbdsec$, when a party sends a message, the adversary is activated by leaking information.
This means that in one activation, each party can only send one message.
The definition of synchronous protocols in the $\{\Fbdsec,\Fclock \}$-hybrid says that in each round each party must send (\texttt{RoundOK}) to $\Fclock$.
Therefore, each party needs $n$ activations, $n-1$ for sending messages and 1 for sending \texttt{RoundOK}.
Finally, any subsequent activation if $p_i$'s bit $d_i$ is still 1, $p_i$ outputs \texttt{early} to the environment.
The ideal world needs these many acivations as well, to invoke the simulator enough to simulate the real world.

The functionality as described in the paper, show in Figure~\ref{fig:sfe} allows the round to advance with only $n-1$ activations through the \texttt{output} message.
The edit to make is to change the \texttt{activated} and \texttt{early} logic to wait until $t_i = 0$ instead of 1. That's all.

It's parameterized by the function $f$ and a polynomial $Rnd$ representing the upper bound on the number of rounds the real world protocol takes. It proceeds in rounds where eact party requires $|\mathcal{P}|$ activations. And it's WRONG.}

Below is the updated version with the correct number of activations.
